## What We're all About

[Jennifer](https://github.com/iennae) and [Aaron](https://github.com/arschles) are learning Go step by step every week on the stream. We start with nothing and work our way up to understanding each part of the language.

## Join Us!

We enjoy having an audience that asks questions and leaves comments on the live stream. 

>All questions and comments are welcome, regardless of how basic or complicated you _think_ they are

(as long as you follow the [code of conduct](https://opensource.microsoft.com/codeofconduct/))

**See you on the stream!**

>If you missed a stream, you can check out past recordings [on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwM5r5-wxvTD0htqjwxUPuPjEygCn-pQJ) (older recordings before July 6, 2020 are [in a different place on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLd5PS0DQ17GCdvijjkLObfahEZzsJCAxO))
