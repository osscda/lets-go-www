## What We're all About

[Jennifer](https://github.com/iennae) and [Aaron](https://github.com/arschles) are learning Go step by step every week on the stream. We start with nothing and work our way up to understanding each part of the language.

## Join Us!

We enjoy having an audience that asks questions and leaves comments on the live stream. 

>All questions and comments are welcome, regardless of how basic or complicated you _think_ they are
